      q: "What is the best business structure for my new venture?",
      a: "The optimal structure depends on factors like the nature of your business, funding needs, liability concerns, tax implications, and growth plans. Sole proprietorships are simple but offer no liability protection. Partnerships are easy to form but share liability. Private limited companies provide liability protection and credibility but require more compliance. LLPs combine partnership flexibility with limited liability. We provide personalized recommendations after understanding your specific needs."

      q: "How long does it take to incorporate a private limited company in India?",
      a: "Typically, incorporating a private limited company takes 15-20 working days from the submission of all required documents. This includes name approval (2-3 days), document preparation and filing (5-7 days), and certificate of incorporation issuance (7-10 days). The process may take longer if there are government queries or during peak filing periods."
    },
    {
      q: "What documents are required to register a business entity?",
      a: "Required documents generally include ID proofs (PAN card, Aadhaar card) of all promoters/directors, address proofs (utility bills, rent agreement) of registered office, photographs of promoters/directors, and business-specific documents. For companies and LLPs, additional documents like NOC from property owner, digital signatures, and a proposed name list are required. The specific requirements vary based on the type of business structure."
    },
    {
      q: "What are the ongoing compliance requirements after incorporation?",
      a: "Compliance requirements vary by business structure. Private limited companies must file annual returns, financial statements, hold board meetings, maintain statutory registers, and comply with various provisions of the Companies Act. LLPs need to file annual returns and statement of accounts. Sole proprietorships have minimal compliance but may need specific industry licenses. All businesses must comply with GST, income tax, and other applicable laws based on their activities."

    {
      q: "Can a foreign national or NRI incorporate a company in India?",
      a: "Yes, foreign nationals and NRIs can incorporate companies in India, subject to FDI regulations. They can be directors in Indian companies and hold shares as per sectoral caps. NRIs can often incorporate with similar procedures as residents, while foreign nationals may need additional documentation like passport copies with visa details and address proof in their home country. Certain business sectors may have restrictions or require special approvals for foreign investment."
