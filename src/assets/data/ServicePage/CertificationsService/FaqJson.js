      q: "What is a Lower TDS Certificate and when is it required?",
      a: "A Lower TDS Certificate (Form 13) is issued by the Income Tax Department allowing deduction of tax at a rate lower than the standard rate. It's required when a taxpayer believes their total income for the year will be below the taxable limit or significantly lower than the previous year. Common scenarios include individuals with housing loan interest, landlords with property depreciation, or businesses expecting losses or reduced profits."

    {
      q: "What documentation is needed for a Repatriation Certificate?",
      a: "For a Repatriation Certificate (Form 15CA/15CB), you typically need documentation of the foreign remittance (purpose, amount, recipient details), supporting invoices or agreements justifying the payment, proof of TDS deduction if applicable, PAN details of the remitter, and bank details including FIRC. For Form 15CB specifically, we'll need to review these documents for certification before submission."

    {
      q: "How is the value determined for a House Property Certificate?",
      a: "House Property valuation considers several factors including the property's location, size, age, construction quality, amenities, current market rates in the area, and recent comparable sales. We use either the fair market value method, rental capitalization method, or cost approach method depending on the property type and certificate purpose. The valuation is conducted in accordance with applicable tax and legal requirements."

    {
      q: "What is a Net Worth Certificate and why might I need one?",
      a: "A Net Worth Certificate is an official document that verifies an individual's or organization's financial position by calculating the difference between total assets and total liabilities. It's commonly required for visa applications, educational loan applications, bidding for government contracts, credit applications, participation in government schemes, loan restructuring, or regulatory compliance for certain businesses."
    },
    {
      q: "How long does it take to obtain various certificates?",
      a: "Processing times vary by certificate type. Lower TDS Certificates typically take 15-30 days from application as they require Income Tax Department approval. Repatriation Certificates (15CA/15CB) can be processed within 1-3 business days. House Property and Net Worth Certificates generally take 3-7 business days, depending on the complexity and documentation readiness. Other attestations typically require 2-5 business days."
