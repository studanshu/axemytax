      q: "What is the difference between statutory audit and tax audit?",
      a: "A statutory audit is mandated by law for certain companies based on their structure or size, focusing on examining financial statements to ensure they provide a true and fair view of the company's financial position. Tax audit, on the other hand, is specific to income tax compliance, required for businesses with turnover exceeding specific thresholds or for professionals with specified gross receipts. It focuses on verifying tax compliance and is governed by Section 44AB of the Income Tax Act."

High-value inventory items might be verified more frequently. Some businesses also implement continuous auditing approaches with regular sample checks throughout the year."
