    {
      q: "What types of documents can be attested by chartered accountants?",
      a: "Chartered accountants can attest various documents including financial statements, balance confirmation certificates, capital contribution certificates, turnover certificates, income certificates, bank transaction documents, projected financial statements, signature verifications, true copy certifications, and various other financial and legal documents requiring professional verification."
    },
    {
      q: "Why do I need document attestation by a CA?",
      a: "CA attestation adds professional credibility and verification to your documents. It's often required by banks (for loan processing), government agencies (for regulatory compliance), foreign authorities (for visa applications), business partners (for due diligence), courts (for legal proceedings), and educational institutions (for scholarship or financial aid applications)."
    },
    {
      q: "What is the difference between attestation and notarization?",
      a: "CA attestation involves verification of financial information and compliance with accounting standards by a professional accountant. Notarization, performed by a notary public, primarily verifies the authenticity of signatures and documents without necessarily validating the content. Many situations require both for different purposes."
    },
    {
      q: "How long is an attested document valid?",
      a: "The validity period varies based on the purpose and the requiring institution. Generally, most organizations accept attestations issued within the last 3-6 months. For specific purposes like visa applications, the validity might be limited to 30-90 days. It's advisable to check the specific requirements of the receiving organization."
    },
    {
      q: "Can you attest photocopies of original documents?",
      a: "Yes, we can attest photocopies as 'True Copies' after verifying them against the original documents. However, for certain attestations that require verification of actual financial data, we would need to review original records and supporting evidence before providing certification."
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need to be present during the attestation process?",
      a: "While physical presence is not always mandatory, we may require a brief meeting (in person or virtual) for specific attestations, especially those involving signature verification or where direct confirmation of certain details is necessary. Many attestations can be processed by submitting documents electronically or through courier."
