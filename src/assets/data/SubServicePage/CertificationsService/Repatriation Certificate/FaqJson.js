    {
      q: "What are Forms 15CA and 15CB?",
      a: "Forms 15CA and 15CB are regulatory forms required under the Income Tax Act for making foreign remittances from India. Form 15CB is a certificate issued by a Chartered Accountant confirming the tax implications and applicable rates on the foreign payment. Form 15CA is a declaration form submitted online by the remitter, which includes details certified in Form 15CB."
    },
    {
      q: "When are Forms 15CA and 15CB required?",
      a: "These forms are required when an Indian resident makes a payment to a non-resident or foreign entity. However, there are certain exceptions based on payment amount and nature. Generally, payments exceeding ₹5 lakh or those not covered under specified exempt categories require both forms. Smaller payments may require only Form 15CA (without CA certification) depending on specific circumstances."
    },
    {
      q: "What information is needed to prepare Form 15CB?",
      a: "To prepare Form 15CB, we require details of the remitter and recipient, nature of payment, applicable section of the Income Tax Act, invoice details, relevant contract documentation, details of any tax deduction, and applicable DTAA benefits if any. The specific documentation requirements may vary based on the nature and purpose of the remittance."
    },
    {
      q: "How long does it take to get Form 15CB certified?",
      a: "Our standard processing time for Form 15CB certification is 24-48 hours from receipt of all required documents. We also offer express same-day service for urgent remittances at additional charges, provided all documentation is submitted before noon."
    },
    {
      q: "Can Form 15CB be prepared for payments already made?",
      a: "Yes, Form 15CB can be prepared for payments that have already been made, though ideally it should be obtained before the remittance. However, banks may require this documentation even for completed transactions, and we can assist in preparing retrospective certifications as needed."
    },
    {
      q: "Do all foreign remittances require Form 15CB certification?",
      a: "No, not all foreign remittances require Form 15CB certification. Payments under ₹5 lakh, personal remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme (within limits), and certain specific payment categories like dividends and interest on FCNR/NRE deposits are exempt. We can advise on specific requirements based on your transaction details."
