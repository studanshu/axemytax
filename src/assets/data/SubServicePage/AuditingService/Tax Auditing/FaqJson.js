    {
      q: "Who is required to get a tax audit done?",
      a: "Under Section 44AB of the Income Tax Act, a tax audit is mandatory for businesses with turnover exceeding ₹1 crore (₹2 crores if cash receipts and payments are less than 5% of total transactions) and professionals with gross receipts exceeding ₹50 lakhs. Certain businesses claiming presumptive taxation benefits but declaring income lower than the presumed rate also need a tax audit."
    },
    {
      q: "What is the difference between Form 3CA and 3CB?",
      a: "Form 3CA is used when the taxpayer is subject to a statutory audit under any law (like Companies Act), and Form 3CB is used when the taxpayer is not subject to any statutory audit. Both forms are accompanied by Form 3CD, which contains the detailed tax audit report."
    },
    {
      q: "What is the deadline for completing a tax audit?",
      a: "The tax audit report must typically be filed by September 30th following the end of the relevant financial year. However, the tax department occasionally extends this deadline. It's advisable to complete the audit well before the deadline to allow time for any corrections."
    },
    {
      q: "What are the consequences of not getting a tax audit done?",
      a: "Failure to get a tax audit done when required can result in a penalty of 0.5% of total sales, turnover, or gross receipts, subject to a maximum of ₹1.5 lakhs. Additionally, the tax department may disallow certain expenses and deductions during assessment."
    },
    {
      q: "Can the same auditor conduct both statutory and tax audits?",
      a: "Yes, the same chartered accountant can conduct both statutory and tax audits for a client. In fact, this often leads to a more efficient audit process as the auditor is already familiar with the client's financial statements and accounting systems."
