      q: "What is fixed asset verification?",
      a: "Fixed asset verification is the process of physically inspecting and confirming the existence, condition, location, and ownership of an organization's fixed assets. It ensures that the assets recorded in the financial statements actually exist and are properly valued, helping prevent fraud and misstatement of financial information."
    },
    {
      q: "How often should fixed assets be verified?",
      a: "Fixed assets should generally be verified at least annually, typically at the end of the financial year. However, high-value assets or assets that are portable and at higher risk of misplacement or theft might require more frequent verification. Some organizations implement a rolling verification program where different categories of assets are verified throughout the year."
    },
    {
      q: "What are the benefits of regular fixed asset verification?",
      a: "Regular fixed asset verification helps ensure accurate financial reporting, prevents fraud and theft, facilitates proper insurance coverage, improves asset utilization, ensures compliance with tax regulations, assists in planning for replacements and upgrades, and provides better control over maintenance costs."
    },
    {
      q: "What is the difference between fixed asset verification and fixed asset management?",
      a: "Fixed asset verification is a specific activity involving the physical checking of assets against records, while fixed asset management is a broader process that includes acquisition, tracking, maintenance, depreciation, and disposal of assets throughout their lifecycle. Verification is a key component of effective asset management."
    },
    {
      q: "How can we prepare for a fixed asset verification?",
      a: "To prepare for a fixed asset verification, update your fixed asset register, ensure assets are properly tagged with identification numbers, organize ownership and purchase documentation, prepare depreciation schedules, train staff on the verification process, and ensure access to all locations where assets are stored."
