    {
      q: "Who is required to undergo GST audit?",
      a: "Businesses with an annual aggregate turnover exceeding â‚¹5 crore are required to undergo mandatory GST audit by a Chartered Accountant or Cost Accountant. The audit includes filing form GSTR-9C (Reconciliation Statement) along with the annual return GSTR-9. However, businesses below this threshold may also opt for voluntary GST audits to ensure compliance and identify potential tax optimizations."
    },
    {
      q: "What is the difference between GST annual return and GST audit?",
      a: "The GST annual return (GSTR-9) is a consolidated summary of all monthly/quarterly returns filed during the financial year, required to be filed by all regular taxpayers. The GST audit involves a professional examining your books of accounts and GST returns to verify compliance, reconcile financial statements with GST returns, and certify the reconciliation statement (GSTR-9C), which is mandatory only for businesses with turnover above the specified threshold."
    },
    {
      q: "What are the common discrepancies found during GST audits?",
      a: "Common discrepancies include: Mismatch between turnover reported in financial statements and GST returns, unclaimed or incorrectly claimed input tax credits, errors in applying reverse charge mechanism, incorrect HSN/SAC code classifications, discrepancies in tax rates applied, missing invoices or supporting documents, errors in reporting exempt, nil-rated, or zero-rated supplies, and non-reconciliation of e-way bills with invoices."
    },
    {
      q: "What are the benefits of a voluntary GST audit?",
      a: "Voluntary GST audits provide several benefits: Early identification of compliance gaps and tax exposure, maximization of eligible input tax credits, prevention of interest and penalty implications, improved GST processes and record-keeping practices, assurance of accurate tax reporting, preparation for potential departmental audits or scrutiny, and peace of mind regarding GST compliance."
    },
    {
      q: "What happens if discrepancies are found during a GST audit?",
      a: "When discrepancies are found, our approach involves: Detailed documentation of findings with supporting evidence, quantification of tax implications (additional liability or eligible credits), preparation of revised returns or rectification submissions as applicable, development of corrective measures to prevent future occurrences, assistance with voluntary tax payment to minimize penalty exposure, and guidance on strengthening internal controls for future compliance."
    },
    {
      q: "What is the deadline for GST audit completion?",
      a: "The GST audit must be completed and the reconciliation statement (GSTR-9C) along with the annual return (GSTR-9) must be filed by December 31st following the end of the financial year. For example, for the financial year 2024-25, the audit must be completed and returns filed by December 31, 2025. However, this date is occasionally extended by the government in special circumstances."
