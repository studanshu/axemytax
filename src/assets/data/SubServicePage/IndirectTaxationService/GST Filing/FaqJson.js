    {
      q: "What are the different types of GST returns that need to be filed?",
      a: "The main GST returns include: GSTR-1 (monthly/quarterly outward supplies), GSTR-3B (monthly/quarterly summary return), GSTR-4 (annual return for composition dealers), GSTR-9 (annual return), and GSTR-9C (reconciliation statement for businesses with turnover above ₹5 crore). The applicable returns depend on your business category, turnover, and registration type."
    },
    {
      q: "What are the due dates for GST return filing?",
      a: "GSTR-1: 11th of the following month (monthly) or last day of the month following the quarter (quarterly). GSTR-3B: 20th of the following month (monthly) or 22nd/24th for smaller taxpayers. GSTR-4: 30th April following the end of the financial year. GSTR-9/9C: 31st December following the end of the financial year. Late filing attracts penalties and interest charges."
    },
    {
      q: "What happens if I miss the GST return filing deadline?",
      a: "Missing GST return deadlines results in: Late filing fees (₹50 per day, maximum ₹10,000), interest on tax liability (18% per annum), potential input tax credit restrictions, automatic blocking of e-way bill generation, and penalty notices. Persistent non-compliance can lead to registration cancellation. We recommend always filing on time or seeking extensions when available."
    },
    {
      q: "How do I handle discrepancies in my GST returns?",
      a: "For handling discrepancies: First identify the source (invoice mismatches, ITC differences, etc.). Reconcile the differences using the GSTR-2B and vendor data. Correct errors in subsequent returns through amendments. For major discrepancies, consider filing revised returns where permitted. Our team assists with reconciliation to minimize discrepancies and ensure compliance."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I claim input tax credit for previous periods?",
      a: "Yes, you can claim unclaimed input tax credit (ITC) for previous periods, but there are time limitations: ITC can be claimed until the due date of September month return of the following financial year or the date of annual return filing, whichever is earlier. Certain restrictions apply to previously unclaimed ITC, so it's important to maintain proper documentation to support these claims."
    },
    {
      q: "Is GST filing different for different types of businesses?",
      a: "Yes, GST filing requirements vary based on: Business type (goods vs. services), registration category (regular vs. composition), turnover threshold, transaction types (B2B, B2C, exports, imports), and special categories (e-commerce operators, TCS/TDS deductors). Each business type has specific return forms, frequencies, and compliance requirements. Our services are customized to your specific business category."
