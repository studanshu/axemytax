    {
      q: "Who needs to register for GST?",
      a: "GST registration is mandatory for businesses with an annual aggregate turnover exceeding ₹40 lakhs (₹20 lakhs for special category states) for goods suppliers and ₹20 lakhs for service providers. Businesses involved in interstate supplies, e-commerce operations, or those required to collect tax at source must register regardless of turnover."
    },
    {
      q: "What is the difference between regular and composition schemes?",
      a: "The regular scheme requires detailed compliance with monthly/quarterly returns and allows input tax credit. The composition scheme is available for businesses with turnover up to ₹1.5 crore, offers simplified quarterly returns, lower tax rates (1% for traders, 5% for restaurants, 6% for others), but doesn't allow input tax credit or interstate supplies."
    },
    {
      q: "How long does GST registration take?",
      a: "Typically, GST registration takes 3-7 working days from the date of complete document submission. The GST portal usually processes applications within 3 business days if all documentation is proper. If any clarification is required, it may take additional time depending on how quickly the deficiencies are addressed."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I apply for multiple GSTINs for different business locations?",
      a: "Yes, GST registration is state-specific. If your business operates in multiple states, you need separate GST registrations for each state. Additionally, within the same state, you can have separate registrations for different business verticals, provided they meet certain conditions specified under GST laws."
    },
    {
      q: "What happens if I don't register for GST despite being eligible?",
      a: "Non-registration despite being eligible can result in penalties of 10% of the tax amount due (minimum ₹10,000), inability to collect GST from customers or claim input tax credits, retrospective tax liability from the date registration was required, and potential business restrictions as unregistered businesses cannot issue tax invoices."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I cancel my GST registration if my turnover falls below the threshold?",
      a: "Yes, if your aggregate turnover falls below the threshold limit, you can apply for GST registration cancellation. However, voluntary registrations must be maintained for at least 12 months before cancellation. The cancellation process requires filing all pending returns, declaring inventory details, and settling any outstanding tax liabilities."
