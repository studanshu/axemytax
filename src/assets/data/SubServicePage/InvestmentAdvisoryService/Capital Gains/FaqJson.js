    {
      q: "What's the difference between short-term and long-term capital gains?",
      a: "Short-term capital gains apply to assets held for less than a specified period (typically 12-36 months depending on the asset type), while long-term capital gains apply to assets held for longer periods. The tax rates differ significantly - short-term gains are taxed at your income tax slab rate, while long-term gains generally enjoy lower tax rates (10% or 20% depending on the asset class) and various exemptions."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I offset my capital losses against capital gains to reduce my tax liability?",
      a: "Yes, capital losses can be set off against capital gains to reduce your tax liability. Short-term capital losses can be set off against both short-term and long-term capital gains, while long-term capital losses can only be set off against long-term capital gains. Any unused losses can be carried forward for up to 8 assessment years to be set off against future capital gains."
    },
    {
      q: "What exemptions are available for capital gains on property sales?",
      a: "Several exemptions are available for property sales: Section 54 allows exemption when you sell a residential property and invest in another residential property. Section 54EC permits exemption (up to ₹50 lakhs) when capital gains are invested in specified bonds. Section 54F provides exemption when you sell assets other than residential property and invest the proceeds in residential property. Each exemption has specific conditions and time limits that must be carefully followed."
    },
    {
      q: "How are equity investments taxed under the capital gains tax regime?",
      a: "For equity shares and equity-oriented mutual funds: Short-term capital gains (held for less than 12 months) are taxed at 15%. Long-term capital gains (held for more than 12 months) exceeding ₹1 lakh in a financial year are taxed at 10% without indexation benefits. Additionally, Securities Transaction Tax (STT) must have been paid at the time of acquisition and sale for these rates to apply."
    },
    {
      q: "What is indexation and how does it help in reducing capital gains tax?",
      a: "Indexation is a method to adjust the purchase price of an asset to account for inflation between the time of purchase and sale. It helps reduce the tax burden by increasing the purchase cost, thus reducing the effective capital gain. The indexed cost is calculated by multiplying the original purchase price with the Cost Inflation Index (CII) ratio. Indexation benefits are available for most long-term capital assets except equity shares and equity-oriented mutual funds."
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need to pay capital gains tax if I reinvest my gains in another investment?",
      a: "It depends on the type of asset and the reinvestment. Specific exemptions exist for reinvestments: For property, reinvesting in another property within specified time limits can provide exemption under Section 54/54F. For other capital assets, reinvesting in specified bonds under Section 54EC (within 6 months) can provide partial exemption. For equities, there's no general reinvestment exemption unless it's part of a corporate action. Our advisory service helps identify the most suitable reinvestment strategies for tax efficiency."
