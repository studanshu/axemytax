      q: "What are corporate fixed deposits and how are they different from bank FDs?",
      a: "Corporate fixed deposits are investment instruments offered by companies (usually NBFCs and manufacturing firms) that typically offer higher interest rates than bank FDs, often by 1-3%. However, unlike bank FDs, corporate deposits are not insured by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) and carry slightly higher risk. They're regulated by RBI (for NBFCs) or the Companies Act (for manufacturing companies) and are rated by credit rating agencies to help investors assess the risk."
    },
    {
      q: "How safe are corporate fixed deposits?",
      a: "The safety of corporate FDs depends on the financial health and credibility of the issuing company. We recommend investments only in corporate FDs with high credit ratings (preferably AA and above) from reputable rating agencies like CRISIL, ICRA, or CARE. While they carry slightly higher risk than bank deposits, selecting companies with strong financials, consistent performance, and good repayment track records can help mitigate this risk. Our due diligence process thoroughly evaluates these factors before recommending any corporate FD."
    },
    {
      q: "What is the minimum investment amount for corporate FDs?",
      a: "The minimum investment amount varies depending on the company, but typically starts at ₹25,000 for most corporate FDs. Some premium or AAA-rated companies may have higher minimum thresholds of ₹50,000 or ₹1,00,000. For senior citizens or special schemes, the minimum amount might be different. Our advisory service can help you identify options that match your available investment amount while maximizing returns."
    },
    {
      q: "What are the taxation rules for corporate fixed deposits?",
      a: "Interest earned on corporate FDs is fully taxable as per your income tax slab rate. TDS is deducted at 10% if interest exceeds ₹5,000 in a financial year (Form 26AS will reflect this deduction). If your total income is below the taxable limit, you can submit Form 15G/15H to avoid TDS deduction. Unlike certain bank FDs, corporate FDs don't offer any special tax benefits under sections like 80C. However, the higher interest rates often compensate for this, resulting in better post-tax returns compared to regular taxable bank FDs."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I withdraw my corporate FD before maturity if I need funds?",
      a: "Yes, most corporate FDs allow premature withdrawals, but they typically come with penalty charges ranging from 0.5% to 1% of the interest rate. Some companies may have a lock-in period of 3-6 months before allowing premature withdrawals. The exact penalty and conditions vary by company and should be considered when selecting an FD. If liquidity is a concern, we can help structure your investments with laddered maturity dates or recommend companies with more flexible premature withdrawal terms."
    },
    {
      q: "How should I choose between different corporate FDs available in the market?",
      a: "Selecting the right corporate FD involves evaluating multiple factors: First, check the credit rating (AAA/AA+ are considered safest). Second, compare interest rates for your preferred tenure. Third, review the company's financial stability and repayment history. Fourth, consider features like interest payout options (monthly/quarterly/annual/cumulative). Fifth, evaluate liquidity needs and premature withdrawal penalties. Our advisory service conducts this comprehensive analysis for you, providing personalized recommendations based on your risk appetite and financial goals."
