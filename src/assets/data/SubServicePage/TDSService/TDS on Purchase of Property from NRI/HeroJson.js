  description:
    "When purchasing property from a Non-Resident Indian (NRI), Section 195 of the Income Tax Act mandates TDS deduction at a higher rate of 20%. This compliance requirement is more complex than domestic property transactions and requires proper handling to avoid significant penalties. Our specialized service helps you navigate this process, ensuring correct TDS calculation, timely deposit with authorities, proper documentation, and Form 16A issuance to NRI sellers. We safeguard your property investment while maintaining full legal compliance with cross-border tax regulations.",
