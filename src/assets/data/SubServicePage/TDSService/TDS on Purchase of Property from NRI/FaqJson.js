      q: "Why is the TDS rate higher for property purchases from NRIs?",
      a: "The higher TDS rate of 20% for property purchases from NRIs (compared to 1% for resident Indians) is mandated under Section 195 of the Income Tax Act. This higher rate serves multiple purposes: It ensures tax compliance from non-residents who might otherwise be difficult to track for tax authorities. It accounts for the potentially higher tax liability NRIs might have on capital gains. It works as a security mechanism for the government to collect appropriate taxes from cross-border transactions. This rate may be reduced if the NRI applies for relief under Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA) or obtains a lower deduction certificate under Section 197."

    {
      q: "Can the 20% TDS rate be reduced when buying property from an NRI?",
      a: "Yes, the 20% TDS rate can potentially be reduced through two methods: The NRI seller can apply for a certificate under Section 197 by submitting Form 13 to their Assessing Officer, demonstrating that their actual tax liability would be lower. If approved, you can deduct TDS at the rate specified in this certificate. Alternatively, if the NRI is from a country that has a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) with India, they may be eligible for beneficial tax rates. This requires the NRI to obtain a Tax Residency Certificate from their country of residence and submit Form 10F for DTAA benefits."
    },
    {
      q: "What forms are required when making payment to an NRI for property purchase?",
      a: "When making payment to an NRI for a property purchase, besides the standard TDS forms, you must also submit: Form 15CA - This online form discloses details of the foreign remittance and tax deducted. Form 15CB - This is a chartered accountant's certificate confirming the appropriate tax treatment of the payment. These forms are mandatory for all foreign remittances above specified thresholds and must be submitted online through the income tax portal before making the payment to the NRI. Our service includes preparation and submission of these forms to ensure complete compliance with foreign remittance reporting requirements."
    },
    {
      q: "What happens if I don't deduct TDS when buying property from an NRI?",
      a: "Not deducting TDS when purchasing property from an NRI has severe consequences: You become an 'assessee in default' under Section 201 of the Income Tax Act. You may be liable to pay the entire TDS amount plus interest @1% per month. Additional penalties up to the TDS amount can be imposed. You may face difficulties in registering the property as many registration offices verify TDS compliance. In extreme cases, the transaction could be scrutinized for potential money laundering concerns. Given these serious implications, professional assistance is highly recommended for NRI property transactions."
    },
    {
      q: "Is PAN mandatory for the NRI seller in a property transaction?",
      a: "Yes, PAN is mandatory for the NRI seller in a property transaction. Without the seller's PAN, you would be required to deduct TDS at the higher of: 20% as applicable to NRIs, or the applicable tax rate plus a 20% surcharge. This significantly increases the tax burden. Additionally, without PAN, the NRI seller will face difficulties in claiming credit for the TDS deducted and may incur higher tax liability. If an NRI doesn't have a PAN, they should apply for one before proceeding with the property sale. Our service can guide NRI sellers through the PAN application process if needed."
    },
    {
      q: "How do I determine if the seller is an NRI for TDS purposes?",
      a: "Determining NRI status for TDS purposes is based on the residential status criteria under the Income Tax Act: An individual is an NRI if they stayed in India for less than 182 days in the previous financial year, or if they stayed for less than 60 days in the previous financial year and less than 365 days in the 4 years before that. Documents to verify this include: passport with entry/exit stamps, visa status verification, overseas residence proof, and sometimes tax residency certificates from foreign countries. Incorrectly determining residential status can lead to TDS disputes, so professional verification is recommended."
