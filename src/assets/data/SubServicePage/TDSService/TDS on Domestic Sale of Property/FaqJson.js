    {
      q: "When is TDS applicable on property purchase?",
      a: "TDS is mandatory under Section 194-IA of the Income Tax Act when purchasing immovable property (land, building, or both) from a resident seller at a consideration of â‚¹50 lakhs or more. The buyer must deduct 1% of the total consideration as TDS. This applies to all types of immovable property including residential houses, commercial buildings, and land. However, agricultural land transactions are exempt from this TDS requirement."
    },
    {
      q: "What is the due date for depositing TDS on property purchase?",
      a: "The TDS amount must be deposited with the government within 30 days from the end of the month in which the property payment is made or transfer is effected (whichever is earlier). For example, if you make a property payment on April 15, the TDS must be deposited by May 30. This is done by filing Form 26QB online. Missing this deadline results in interest charges at 1% per month and potential penalties."
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need a TAN for deducting TDS on property purchase?",
      a: "No, a TAN (Tax Deduction Account Number) is not required for TDS deduction under Section 194-IA for property transactions. This is a special provision designed to simplify compliance for one-time property buyers. Instead, you can use your PAN (Permanent Account Number) to deposit TDS using Form 26QB. This is different from most other TDS provisions where having a TAN is mandatory for the deductor."
    },
    {
      q: "How do I get TDS credit for the seller after deduction?",
      a: "After depositing TDS, Form 16B (TDS Certificate) is generated by the Income Tax Department, which should be downloaded and provided to the seller. This typically takes 7-14 days after TDS payment. The seller can claim credit for this TDS in their income tax return using the details from Form 16B. Without this certificate, the seller may face difficulties in claiming TDS credit, so timely processing is important."
    },
    {
      q: "What happens if I don't deduct TDS on property purchase?",
      a: "Failure to deduct TDS can result in serious consequences: You may be deemed an 'assessee in default' under tax laws. A penalty equal to the TDS amount can be imposed. Interest at 1% per month is applicable from the date TDS was required till the actual payment date. Additionally, you might face challenges during property registration as many registration offices verify TDS compliance for high-value transactions."
    },
    {
      q: "Is TDS applicable on the entire property value including GST/registration charges?",
      a: "TDS should be calculated on the total consideration paid for the property transfer. If GST is explicitly mentioned separately in the agreement and paid directly to government authorities, it may be excluded from TDS calculation. However, if paid to the seller along with property value, it becomes part of the consideration. Registration and stamp duty charges paid directly to government authorities are not subject to TDS. For clarity on your specific transaction, we recommend a consultation with our tax experts."
