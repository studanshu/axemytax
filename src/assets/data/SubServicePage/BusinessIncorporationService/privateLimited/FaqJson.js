      q: "What is a Private Limited Company?",
      a: "A Private Limited Company is a type of corporate structure where the liability of members is limited to their shareholding, offering protection of personal assets. It's regulated under the Companies Act, 2013, and has a separate legal existence distinct from its shareholders. Key characteristics include: restricted right to transfer shares, limited number of shareholders (up to 200), prohibition on inviting capital from the public, minimum two directors and shareholders required, perpetual succession regardless of changes in membership, and ability to own property and enter contracts in its own name. It's the most popular structure for serious businesses due to its credibility, scalability, and liability protection."

Third, apply for company name reservation through RUN (Reserve Unique Name) service with the MCA, providing multiple name options. Fourth, draft the Memorandum of Association (MOA) and Articles of Association (AOA) defining the company's objectives and internal rules. Fifth, file the SPICe+ form (Simplified Proforma for Incorporating Company Electronically Plus) with all required documents. Finally, upon approval, receive the Certificate of Incorporation with CIN (Corporate Identity Number).

      q: "What is the minimum capital requirement for a Private Limited Company?",
      a: "Under the Companies Act, 2013 (as amended), there is no minimum paid-up capital requirement for incorporating a Private Limited Company in India. Previously, a minimum capital of ₹1 lakh was required, but this requirement was removed to promote ease of doing business. Now, you can incorporate a company with any nominal amount (even ₹1), though most companies typically start with ₹1 lakh to ₹10 lakhs depending on business needs. While there's no statutory minimum, practical considerations like business scale, bank requirements, investor expectations, and industry regulations may influence your decision on initial capital. The capital can be increased later through proper procedures."
