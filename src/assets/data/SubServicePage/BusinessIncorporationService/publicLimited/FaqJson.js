      q: "What is a Public Limited Company?",
      a: "A Public Limited Company is the most advanced form of company structure, regulated under the Companies Act, 2013. Unlike private companies, public companies can offer shares to the general public and have no restrictions on share transferability. They require a minimum of seven shareholders, three directors, and typically a higher minimum capital (though legally there's no minimum capital requirement now). Public companies must use 'Limited' as the last word in their name, maintain more comprehensive financial disclosures, and follow stricter corporate governance standards. While most start as unlisted entities, they have the potential to get listed on stock exchanges through IPOs, enabling broader access to capital markets."

    {
      q: "What are the key differences between Private Limited and Public Limited companies?",
      a: "The key differences include: Minimum members - Public companies require at least 7 shareholders vs 2 for private companies; Minimum directors - Public companies need at least 3 directors vs 2 for private companies; Transferability of shares - Public companies have freely transferable shares while private companies have restrictions; Public offering - Public companies can invite the public to subscribe to their securities, private companies cannot; Board composition - Public companies often require independent directors and women directors; Compliance requirements - Public companies face significantly higher compliance and disclosure obligations; Financial statements - Public companies have stricter financial reporting standards; AGM requirements - Public companies have more formal Annual General Meeting procedures; and Name suffix - Public companies use 'Limited' while private companies use 'Private Limited'."

      q: "What are the advantages and disadvantages of forming a Public Limited Company?",
      a: "Advantages include: Unlimited capital raising potential through public share offerings; greater business credibility and market reputation; perpetual succession and separate legal entity status; limited liability protection for shareholders; easier transfer of ownership through share transactions; potential for listing on stock exchanges; broader options for employee equity incentives; and enhanced visibility in the marketplace. Disadvantages include: Significantly higher compliance requirements and regulatory oversight; increased costs of formation and ongoing maintenance; less privacy due to public disclosure requirements; more complex decision-making processes; mandatory audits and financial disclosures; requirement for multiple statutory committees; and potential vulnerability to hostile takeovers once listed. The structure is best suited for large-scale enterprises with substantial capital requirements."

      q: "When should a business consider incorporating as a Public Limited Company?",
      a: "A business should consider the public limited structure when: It requires substantial capital that exceeds what private investors can provide; it has plans for eventual listing on stock exchanges through an IPO; it needs to create a broad-based ownership structure across many shareholders; the business has reached significant scale with annual turnover typically exceeding â‚¹50-100 crores; the promoters are prepared for the transparency and governance requirements; the company can bear the higher compliance costs and administrative burden; the business model is proven and has strong growth prospects; industry regulations favor or require the public company structure; or when greater public visibility would significantly benefit the business. Most companies start as private limited and convert to public limited when they reach appropriate scale and maturity."
