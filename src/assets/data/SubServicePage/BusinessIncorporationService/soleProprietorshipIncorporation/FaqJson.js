      q: "What is a Sole Proprietorship business?",
      a: "A Sole Proprietorship is the simplest form of business structure where an individual owns and operates the business in their personal capacity. There is no legal distinction between the owner and the business entity. The proprietor has complete control over the business, receives all profits (subject to taxation as personal income), and bears unlimited liability for all business debts and obligations."
    },
    {
      q: "Is registration mandatory for a Sole Proprietorship in India?",
      a: "Unlike companies or LLPs, Sole Proprietorships don't require mandatory registration with central government authorities. However, depending on the nature of business and location, you may need registrations such as: Shop & Establishment license from local municipal authorities, MSME/Udyam registration for government benefits, GST registration (mandatory if turnover exceeds ₹40 lakhs for goods or ₹20 lakhs for services), and industry-specific licenses (food license, trade license, etc.). Our service helps identify and obtain all applicable registrations."
    },
    {
      q: "What are the advantages of a Sole Proprietorship?",
      a: "Sole Proprietorships offer several advantages: Easiest and least expensive business structure to establish, complete control over all business decisions, minimal compliance requirements compared to other structures, no separate tax filing (business income is reported in personal income tax returns), flexibility to make quick business decisions, simplified accounting and record-keeping, and easy to dissolve if business needs change. It's ideal for small-scale entrepreneurs, professionals, and those testing new business ideas."
    },
    {
      q: "What are the limitations of a Sole Proprietorship?",
      a: "Key limitations include: Unlimited personal liability (your personal assets can be used to satisfy business debts), difficulty raising capital (cannot issue shares), limited business continuity (business typically ends with owner's retirement/death), challenges in business expansion due to funding limitations, no separate legal entity status, and potential credibility issues with large clients or vendors. As your business grows, you might consider transitioning to structures like LLP or Private Limited Company."
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need a separate bank account for my Sole Proprietorship?",
      a: "While legally you can use your personal bank account for business transactions, opening a separate current account in your business name is strongly recommended for several reasons: Easier tracking of business income and expenses, more professional image when dealing with clients and vendors, simplified tax preparation and compliance, better organization of financial records, and clearer separation of personal and business finances. Our service includes assistance with opening a current account for your business."
    },
    {
      q: "How is a Sole Proprietorship taxed in India?",
      a: "In a Sole Proprietorship, business income is treated as the proprietor's personal income and taxed according to the applicable income tax slabs. You need to file your personal income tax return using ITR-3 or ITR-4 (for presumptive taxation), including profits from your business. If your business turnover exceeds specified limits, you'll need to maintain proper books of accounts and possibly get them audited. GST compliance is required if your turnover crosses the threshold limits. Our service includes basic tax guidance specific to your business situation."
