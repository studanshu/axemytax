      q: "What is an international digital signature certificate?",
      a: "An international digital signature certificate is an electronic authentication credential that complies with global standards like WebTrust and is recognized across multiple countries. Unlike domestic certificates that work only within India, international DSCs allow you to digitally sign documents that are legally valid across borders, participate in international tenders, sign cross-border agreements, and conduct global e-commerce activities securely."
    },
    {
      q: "In which countries is the international digital signature valid?",
      a: "Our international digital signature certificates are typically recognized in most major economies including the USA, UK, European Union countries, Singapore, UAE, Australia, and many others. The certificates comply with international standards like Adobe Approved Trust List (AATL) and European Union eIDAS regulations, making them widely accepted. However, specific country requirements may vary, and we can provide guidance for your target countries."
    },
    {
      q: "What is the difference between a domestic and international digital signature?",
      a: "The key difference is in recognition and compliance. Domestic digital signatures are issued by Indian Certifying Authorities and recognized only within India for domestic purposes. International digital signatures comply with global standards, are issued by internationally accredited authorities, and are recognized across multiple countries, allowing for authenticated electronic transactions worldwide."
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need a passport to get an international digital signature?",
      a: "Yes, a valid passport is typically required as the primary identification document for international digital signature certificates. This is because passports are universally recognized identification documents and help establish your identity across borders. The passport details are embedded in the certificate for international verification purposes."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I use my international digital signature for Indian compliance as well?",
      a: "Yes, international digital signatures can generally be used for Indian compliance requirements as well. They typically meet or exceed the standards required for domestic use, so you can use them for income tax filings, GST submissions, MCA filings, and other domestic purposes in addition to international transactions."
    },
    {
      q: "What if a specific country doesn't recognize my international digital signature?",
      a: "While our international signatures are widely recognized, some countries may have specific requirements or their own digital signature systems. In such cases, we can provide guidance on obtaining country-specific certifications or adapting your documentation to meet local requirements. We recommend discussing your specific geographical needs during the application process."
