    {
      q: "Why should I choose a 3-year validity digital signature over a 2-year one?",
      a: "A 3-year digital signature certificate offers several advantages including cost savings (as it's typically less expensive than purchasing two separate certificates), reduced administrative hassle (avoiding renewal procedures every 2 years), and continuous uninterrupted service for all your digital signing needs. It's particularly beneficial for businesses and professionals who use digital signatures regularly."
    },
    {
      q: "What types of documents can I sign with a domestic digital signature?",
      a: "With a domestic digital signature, you can sign various documents and access multiple services within India including income tax returns (ITR), GST returns, MCA filings (company registrations/annual returns), e-tendering documents, patent applications, banking documents, and various applications on government portals like e-Mudhra, DigiLocker, etc."
    },
    {
      q: "What is the difference between Class 2 and Class 3 digital signatures?",
      a: "Class 2 certificates verify your identity against a pre-verified database and are suitable for income tax filing, GST filing, and most standard business purposes. Class 3 certificates involve physical verification and offer the highest level of security, required for e-tendering, company incorporation, and other high-security applications. Both are available with 3-year validity."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I upgrade from a 2-year to a 3-year certificate if I already have a digital signature?",
      a: "No, digital signature certificates cannot be upgraded or extended once issued. You would need to complete the entire certificate validity period and then apply for a new 3-year certificate when your current one expires. This is why it's worth considering a 3-year certificate from the beginning if you anticipate long-term usage."
    },
    {
      q: "What happens if I lose my digital signature token?",
      a: "If you lose your USB token, you should immediately report it to us and the issuing Certifying Authority to prevent unauthorized use. You would need to apply for a replacement token, which will require a revocation of your old certificate and issuance of a new one with fresh validity. This underscores the importance of keeping your token secure."
    },
    {
      q: "Will my digital signature work on both Windows and Mac operating systems?",
      a: "Yes, digital signature certificates are designed to work across different operating systems, including Windows, Mac, and Linux. However, you may need to install specific drivers for your token on each system. We provide installation support and guidance for setting up your digital signature on your preferred operating system."
